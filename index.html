        In the Trevor Noah book, Trevor Noah describes how 
        his mother, Patricia Noah, has
         influenced and given him strength.<br> 
         He mentioned this in his book by saying, ‘I
         grew up in a world where authority was female.’ 
         She taught him how to<br> face and
          overcome challenges. She did the impossible to raise him. 
          And
           at the end of the day, she made him the way<br> he is today,
            a successful man in the world. So to explain 
            both the mother and child,
             I would have given the title Trevor<br> Noah and Patricia 
             Noah for the book Born in Crime. 
             I believe women should be given admiration for what
              they have done.

    <p id="content">Today, no profession is meant to be only 
        for a man or a woman.
        A Girl can do any job, even though some<br> work is not advisable,
        as it can cause  damage to her physical body. To illustrate,
        I want to mention some of the women<br> who are known for their hard work.

                <br>She is best known for her refusal to move from her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama bus 
                <br>in defiance of Jim Crow laws, which sparked the Montgomery bus boycott. She is also 
                <br>sometimes known as the "mother of the civil rights movement."</p>

    <p id="text">Women in the past were not allowed to work, 
        possess any property, or learn.
        The only thing they<br> could do was get married and give birth. 

        This has damaged the psychology and health of women:
        <br>it make them think they cannot do anything other than 
        raise children. 
         Such an attitude affected <br>the family, 
         country, and the world, because they have much to
          contribute and solve problems. 
       So<br> I believe the whole community should be 
       supportive and do 
       whatever it takes for<br> women to get an education
        and access to health service.  
        </p>
        
        <p id="relationship">Men are also part of the community,
             so they have to help encourage women. 
            But from my experience,<br> most of them including Abel
            want a girl just to be in her home, 
            and take care of the family.
             They do not have <br>a desire for their girl 
             to be independent:
             they do not choose a free, confident girl who has 
             the <br>potential to do all by herself. 
             They want to get married to a 
             girl who can make time for her family.
